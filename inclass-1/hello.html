	<h1>A little bit about myself...</h1>
	<p>
	I was born in Taiwan, but I grew up in Vancouver, Canada. I am a rising Junior and just transferred to Computer Science last semester. I love travelling and playing tennis. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Over the summer, I was part of Rice's startup accelerator, called OwlSpark. Apart from spending 3 months doing that, I also visited my parents in Taiwan. 
	Though I was only there for a week, I spent most of my time visiting relatives, eating stall food, and spending quality time with my dad playing golf.
	I am a little disappointed that I only have a week of vacation, but I am glad to be back on campus!
